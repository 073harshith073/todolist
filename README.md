Abstract:

This web application is a Blog Platform with integrated To-Do List functionality. The platform allows users to create, edit, and display blog posts and manage tasks within a single user interface.

Key Features:

1. **Blog Posts:** Users can create, edit, and view blog posts. Each post consists of a title, content, and an optional image. The application dynamically renders blog posts, making them accessible and easily modifiable.

2. **Image Upload:** Users can include images in their blog posts by providing image URLs during post creation or editing. Images are displayed alongside post content.

3. **To-Do List Integration:** A task symbol button at the bottom of the page allows users to open a popup that displays the content of a To-Do List from an external source (todo.html). This integration provides users with a convenient way to manage tasks alongside their blog content.

4. **Popup Functionality:** The To-Do List content is displayed within a popup modal. Users can open and close the popup using dedicated buttons, enhancing the user experience.

The integration of blogging and task management within a single web application offers users a seamless experience for creating content and managing tasks in one place. This approach improves productivity and organization for individuals and small teams.
